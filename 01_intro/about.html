			<p style= "font-size: 20"> <br> <br> My name is Silvia Festa and I am an Italian high school student. I am currently enrolled in Harvard Secondary School program and this website contains my documentation for the course PHYS S-12. <br>
			I was born in Pisa and I've been studying at the sicence school "Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini" in this city for fuor years. I am involved in Mathematics competitions in my country, and I have taken part to the Italian Mathematics Olimpyads final with my team. I am really interested in Mathematics and Physics and I am planning continue my studies by studying Physics at university. <br> Besides academics my interests include dance music and art: I play the violin and I really like drawing in black and white, 
			but most importantly really enjoy travelling, visiting new places and meeting new people. For me this Summer School is a great opportunity to get in touch with other students that share my interests all around the world.</p>
