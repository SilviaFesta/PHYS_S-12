            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <h4> THE IDEA: </h4>
            <p>I really love to travel and visit new places so for my final project I wanted to create something related to tourism. At first I thought about a smart bag that could follow you around airports and trainstations so that travellers should not worry about heavy luggage anymore. However I wanted my project to be really useful to the society, therefore I started thinking about the main drawbacks of tourism. One of the most annoying aspect of tourism is that tourists often leave trash around the cities damageing some of the most beautiful places in the world.
            Trying to solve this problem an idea came to my mind: how about creating a machine that could be able to detect trash and remove it from the streets? </p>

</div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
              <img src="../Santaangelo_Trash.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:80%" alt="Santaangelo_Trash">
               </div> 
         </div>


            <h4>FEATURES:</h4>
            <p>The machine should be able to: <p/>
                  <ul> 
                       <li> <p> Move in different directions </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> Detect obstacles </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> Pick things from the ground and carry them </p> </li>
                  </ul>

            <p> Therefore the project should include:</p>

                   <ul> 
                       <li> <p> A motor </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> Wheels </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> A sensor to detect obstacles </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> A meccanical arm to pic trash </p> </li>
                       <li> <p> A box to carry the trash it picks </p> </li>
                   </ul>

            <p>In order to make this machine work properly it is important that the sensor is located in the lowest possible position, so that even small obstacles are detected!</p>
